# Chatpdf

This Python script exploits the API of Chatpf (https://www.chatpdf.com/) to create a local chatbot to question a pdf file. In the field 'x-api-key' you have to put the API key generated by subscribing to Chatpdf.com. You have for free 500 messages and 5,000 PDF pages per month, with the possibility to shift to a paying plan. The UI has been created with Gradio interface. 
At first you upload a pdf file clicking on the folder icon and then you can start question the file. It gives you also the references of the information contained in the answer, if explicitly requested in the question.

## Requirements

The libraries you need to install to run the script are:
- gradio (2.9b50)
- reqeusts (2.31.0)
